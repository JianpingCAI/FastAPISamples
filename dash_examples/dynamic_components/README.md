# Note

For dynamically created component, dict id seems to be required; otherwise, `ID not found in layout` error occurs.

1. `main_dynamic_string_id.py`: `ID not found in layout` errors occur.
2. `main_dynamic_dict_id.py`: dict id, no pattern matching
3. `main_dynamic_dict_id_pattern_matching.py`: dict id, pattern matching

Both 2 and 3 work fine.
