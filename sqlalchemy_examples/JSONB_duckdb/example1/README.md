# Code Review

## `find_user_by_name`

The initial implementation of `find_user_by_name` does not work because of the way SQLAlchemy handles JSON fields in the query. Let's compare the two implementations and understand why `find_user_by_name` fails while `find_user_by_age` works.

### Initial `find_user_by_name` Implementation

```python
def find_user_by_name(session, name: str) -> List[Record]:
    """Find user(s) by name."""
    try:
        results = (
            session.query(RecordDB)
            .filter(cast(RecordDB.data["name"], String) == name)
            .all()
        )
        return [Record(**result.data) for result in results]
    except SQLAlchemyError as e:
        print(f"Error finding user by name: {e}")
        return []
```

### Working `find_user_by_age` Implementation

```python
def find_user_by_age(session, age: int) -> List[Record]:
    """Find user(s) by age."""
    try:
        results = (
            session.query(RecordDB)
            .filter(cast(RecordDB.data["age"], Integer) == age)
            .all()
        )
        return [Record(**result.data) for result in results]
    except SQLAlchemyError as e:
        print(f"Error finding user by age: {e}")
        return []
```

### Comparison and Analysis

1. **Type Casting with `cast`**:
    - **For Age**: `find_user_by_age` works because casting `RecordDB.data["age"]` to `Integer` directly compares numerical values, which is straightforward and supported by SQLite.
    - **For Name**: `find_user_by_name` fails because casting `RecordDB.data["name"]` to `String` for comparison does not work well with JSON fields in SQLite. JSON extraction and casting are more complex for string fields within JSON objects.

2. **JSON Handling in SQLite**:
    - **Numerical Comparison**: SQLite handles numerical comparisons within JSON fields relatively straightforwardly, allowing the direct casting and comparison of JSON numerical values.
    - **String Comparison**: String comparisons within JSON fields are more complex. The JSON data type in SQLite doesn't support direct string comparison in the same way as numerical comparison. The `cast` function may not correctly extract and compare the string value within the JSON structure.

3. **Direct Access Using `json_extract`**:
    - The revised implementation of `find_user_by_name` using `json_extract` works because it directly accesses the JSON field using SQLite's `json_extract` function, bypassing the need for casting:

    ```python
    def find_user_by_name(session, name: str) -> List[Record]:
        """Find user(s) by name."""
        try:
            query = text("SELECT * FROM record_table WHERE json_extract(data, '$.name') = :name")
            results = session.execute(query, {'name': name}).fetchall()
            return [Record(**json.loads(row._mapping['data'])) for row in results]
        except SQLAlchemyError as e:
            print(f"Error finding user by name: {e}")
            return []
    ```

### Summary

- **Initial `find_user_by_name` Issue**: The initial implementation fails because casting a JSON string field to a `String` type for comparison does not work as intended in SQLite. The JSON field extraction and comparison are more complex for string data within JSON objects.
- **Working `find_user_by_age`**: This works correctly because numerical comparisons within JSON fields are handled straightforwardly by SQLite.
- **Revised `find_user_by_name`**: The revised implementation uses `json_extract` to directly access the JSON field, which SQLite handles correctly, and then parses the JSON string to create `Record` instances.

By understanding the differences in handling JSON fields for numerical and string comparisons in SQLite, we can see why the initial `find_user_by_name` function did not work and why the revised approach using `json_extract` resolves the issue.
